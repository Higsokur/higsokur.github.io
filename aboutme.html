<h2> About me. </h2>
<p>
    I'm a beginner learning programmer who is interested in a lot of things related to programming. If I had to choose, I would go for software development, frontend or game development but I wouldn't mind backend and OS development as well. <br>
    I use Arch Linux (flex not intended) with hyprland but I still want to experiment with other distros and WMs. I also use Windows for school sadly.
    Also experimenting with code editors so i can't really tell which one I'm using right now.

<h2> Other than programming. </h2>
<p>
    I enjoy playing video games like Geometry Dash, Hollow Knight, Content Warning, R.E.P.O and sometimes Minecraft. I also play other games but it's either I forgot them or I don't play them often. <br>
    I also draw sometimes a silly white fox character named Input Fox (you will often see it in my profile pictures). I usually draw with a mouse and a stabilizer in Krita. I also sometimes draw it on paper and take a picture with my phone and use it for tracing/reference (I'm better on paper than digital <i>for now</i>).

<h2> My username. </h2>
<p>
    Me and my friend once wanted to start a project related to programming and Terraria, and we needed a name. So throught everything: from random name generators to ai generated company names. I also always searched them on google to make sure it wasn't taken. I found a few and showed them to my friend but he lost interest in the project and dropped it. One of those names were "Higsokur" (or something similar) and I end up looking back to it and using it since it was very original. And now I still use it to this day. <br>
    FYI: It's pronounced "hig-so-kurr" :)
