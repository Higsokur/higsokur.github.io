<h2> About me. </h2>
<p>
I'm a beginner programmer who is interested in a lot of things related to programming. If I had to choose, I would go for software development, front-end, or game development, but I wouldn't mind backend and operating system development as well. <br>
I use Arch Linux (flex not intended) with Hyprland, but I still want to experiment with other distros and window managers. I also use Windows for school, sadly.
Also experimenting with code editors, so I can't really tell which one I'm using right now.

<h2> Other than programming. </h2>
<p>
I also draw sometimes, a silly white fox character named Input Fox (you will often see it in my profile pictures). I usually draw with a mouse and a stabilizer in Krita. I also sometimes draw it on paper and take a picture with my phone and use it for tracing/reference (I'm better on paper than digital for now).

<h2> My username. </h2>
<p>
    My friend and I once wanted to start a project related to programming and Terraria, and we needed a name. So we went through everything: from random name generators to AI-generated company names. I also always searched them on Google to make sure they weren't taken. I found a few and showed them to my friend, but he lost interest in the project and dropped it. One of those names was "Higsokur" (or something similar), and I ended up looking back at it and using it since it was very original. And now I still use it to this day. <br> <br>
    <i>FYI: It's pronounced "hig-so-kurr" :)</i>
